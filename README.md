As part of my learning process to master the basics of HTML markup language, I am required to create a website featuring simple recipes. To complete this project, I must apply all my knowledge of the fundamental principles of this language. More specifically, I must be able to write the initial structure of each web page. I must ensure that HTML elements are correctly indented and nested. I must know how to use the appropriate tags and attributes for each element added to my web pages.

In addition, this project is also an opportunity to consolidate my skills in using Git and GitHub.
