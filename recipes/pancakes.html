        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>For anyone who loves to make a delicious breakfast on the weekend or even brunch, you'll love this pancake recipe! These pancakes are light, fluffy, and especially thick, and the blueberries add a fruity flavor that's typically American! Enjoy them as is or with maple syrup. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12.5 g Blueberries</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>0.8 cl Milk</li>
            <li>0.8 cl Whipped cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Maple syrup</li>
            <li>12.5 g Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg.</li>

            <li>Melt the butter. In a large bowl, beat the egg, milk, and cream with an electric mixer. Add the butter, then the flour, and mix until you have a smooth batter.</li>

            <li>Do not defrost the blueberries. Melt a little butter in a hot frying pan, then pour in the batter to make small pancakes.</li>

            <li>Place 1 tablespoon of blueberries on each pancake. When the batter has set and the underside is golden brown, flip the pancakes and brown the other side.</li>

            <li>Keep the finished pancakes warm in the oven. Continue in the same way with the rest of the batter until there is no batter left, adding butter as needed.</li>
            <li>You can serve the pancakes with maple syrup or enjoy them plain. You can also make them without fruit, served only with maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
